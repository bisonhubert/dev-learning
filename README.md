### Big O Notation

#### Important Concepts
1. Growth is with respect to the input
2. Constants are dropped
3. Worst case is usually the way we measure
tl;dr as your input gros, how fast does computation or memory grow?

#### Rates
* O(1) = constant growth
* O(logn) = binary search trees, when you split a list
* O(n) = linear growth, single loop
* O(2n) = linear growth, drop the constant to make it O(n)
* O(n logn) = quicksort
* O(n^2) = (nested loop, going through area of data square by square)
* O(2^n) = (impractical)
* O(n!) = (impractical)
* O(sqrt(n))
